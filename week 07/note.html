        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">AJAX</H3>
        
        <ul>
            <li><strong>AJAX</strong> Technique allowing web pages to communicate asynchronously with a server. Dynamically updates web pages without
            reloading.s</li>
            <li><strong>Clients and Servers</strong>
            Clients request resources from a server, which processes the request and sends back a response to the client.</li>
            <li><strong>APIs</strong> 
            Application programming interface<br>
            
            Collection of methods allowing external access to another program or service.t</li>
            <li>A living standard
            Fetch API spec is still being developed.
            
            Libraries exist to help take care of Ajax requests.
            
            Ex: jQuery has ajax() method used similarly to fetch:
            
            $.ajax('http://numbersapi.com/random').done(text => outputDiv.innerHTML = text );</li>
            
        
        </ul>
        
        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">FUTHER FUNCTIONS</H3>
        <ul>
        <li><strong>functions</strong> are first-class objects</li>
        <li><strong>The call()</strong> method can be used to set the value of this inside a function to an object that is provided as the first
            argument</li>
        <li>If a function doesn’t refer to an object as this in its body, it can still be called using the call() method, but
            you need provide null as its first argument</li>
        <li>Immediately Invoked Function Expression– or IIFE – (pronounced 'iffy') is an anonymous function that is invoked as
            soon as it’s defined</li>
        <li>An IIFE can be used to enclose a block of code inside its own private scope so it doesn’t interfere with any other
            part of the program</li>
        <li><strong>recursive function</strong> is one that invokes itself until a certain condition is met</li>
        <li><strong>Collatz Conjecture</strong> - every positive integer will create a sequence that finishes in this loop</li>
        <li> <strong>'spaghetti code'</strong> more than one callback is used in the same function, resulting in a large number of nested
            blocks that are difficult to comprehend</li>
        <li>Callback hell is the term used to refer to the tangled mess of code</li>
        <li>Promises can be used instead of callbacks to deal with multiple asynchronous actions in sequence. They also provide
            a nicer mechanism for handling errors</li>
        <li>Functions that return other functions are known as higher-order functions</li>
        <li>A closure is the process of keeping a reference to a variable available outside the scope of the function it was
            originally defined in</li>
            
        </ul>
