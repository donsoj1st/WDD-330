        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">HTML5 APIs</H3>
        
        <ul>
        <li><strong>The data- attribute</strong> The data- attribute is a way of embedding data in a web page using custom attributes that are ignored by the browser.
        They’re also private to a page, so are not intended to be used by an external service – their sole purpose is to be used
        by a JavaScript program. This means they’re perfect for adding data that can be used as a hook that the program utilizes
        to access information about a particular element on the page.</li>
        <li><strong>HTML5 APIs</strong> The HTML5 specification contains a number of APIs that help to 
            gain access to hardware, such as cameras, batteries,
            geolocation, and the graphics card. Hardware evolves quickly,
            and APIs are frequently introduced to give developers
            access, and control new features that appear in the latest devices
        </li>
        <li><strong>localStorage</strong> The Web Storage API provides a key-value store on the client’s computer that is similar to using cookies but has fewer
        restrictions, more storage capacity, and is generally easier to use. This makes it perfect for storing information about
        users, as well as storing application-specific information that can then be used during future sessions.
        
        The fact that only strings can be saved might seem like a restriction at first, but by using JSON, we can store any
        JavaScript object in local storage</li>
        <li><strong>geolocation</strong>The Geolocation API is used to obtain the geographical position of the device. This means it can be used to find the
        user’s exact location, then link to nearby places or measure the speed at which the user is moving. This information can
        then be used to filter data based on the user's location or speed and direction of travel</li>
        <li><strong>web worker</strong> We saw in earlier chapters that JavaScript is a single-threaded language, meaning that only one process can run at one
        time. Web workers allow processes to be run in the background, adding support for concurrency in JavaScript.
    </li>
        <li><strong>multimedia</strong> Before HTML5, it was notoriously difficult to display audio and video in browsers, and plugins such as Flash often had
        to be used. HTML5 introduced the audio and video tags used to insert audio and video clips into a web page. It also
        introduced a Media API for controlling the playback of the clips using JavaScript</li>
        <li><strong>Drawing shapes with canvas</strong> The canvas element was introduced to allow graphics to be drawn onto a web page in real time using JavaScript. A canvas
        element is a rectangular element on the web page. It has a coordinate system that starts at (0,0) in the top-left
        corner. To add a canvas element to a page, the canvas tag is used specifying a height and width
    </li>
        
            
        
        </ul>
        
        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">The Window Object</H3>
        <ul>
            <li>window object is the global object in a browser</li>
            <li><strong>alert() , confirm() , and prompt()</strong>  are all methods of the window object, and open dialogs that halt the execution of
                the program</li>
            <li><strong>Cookies</strong> can be used to store small pieces of information between requests using the document.cookie property</li>
            <li>The <strong>window.setTimeout()</strong> method can be used to invoke a function after a set amount of time</li>
            <li>The <strong>window.requestAnimationFrame()</strong> method can be used to produce smooth and optimized animation by utilizing the
                browser's built-in graphics capabilities</li>

                    
        </ul>
