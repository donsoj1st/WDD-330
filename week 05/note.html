        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">NOTE</H3>
        <P> A note from the book: "Programmer errors are our responsibility, so we must ensure they are minimized as much as
            possible and fixed promptly. We also should try to limit user errors by predicting any possible input that the user might enter,
            that will lead to errors, in fact, also programmer errors, because the program should be designed in a way
            that prevents the user from making the error." I like the point the author is making about user errors being programmer
            errors. A well-designed program should take the user into account and be easy to use.
        </P>
        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">srtict mode</H3>
        <ol>
            
            <li><strong>srtict mode</strong> Produces more exceptions and warnings, and prohibits use of some deprecated features.</li> 
            
          <li><strong>usage</strong> add 'use strict'; to top of javascript file or function to apply to entire file or only function.</li> 
        </ol>
        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">Feature Detection</H3>
        <p>
            Used to determine browser suppoert for a feature (API)
        </p>
        
        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">Debugging in the Browser</H3>
        <ul>
           <li><strong>Alert</strong> alert() method can be used to dialogs at certain points in the code. Effectively adds a breakpoint if desired. Not
        recommended now because of more options today.</li> 
            
            
          <li><strong>Using the Console</strong> Use console object. EX: console.log(), console.trace(), etc></li> 
            
            
           <li><strong>Debugging Tools</strong>
            Can be used to set breakpoints.<br>
            debugger keyword can be used to create breakpoints in the code.
        </li>
            
        </ul>
        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">Throwing Exceptions</H3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>THROW</strong> Use throw statement to handle your own exceptions. Best practice dictates throwing
                 an error object, which is caught in a catch block.
        </li>
        
        
            <li>
                <strong>Exception Handling</strong> 
                use to handle exceptions by catching errors in the catch block.
            </li>
        
        
            <li><strong>try, catch, and finally</strong> 
            Wrap code that can result in an exception in a try block.
            </li>
        
        </ul>
        <H3 style="color: #250c06be;">TEST DRIVEN DEVELOPMENT</H3>
        <ul>
            <li>writw tests (that initially fail)</li> 
            <li>
                Write code to pass the tests
            </li>
            <li>Refactor the code</li>
            <li>Test refactored code</li>
            <li>Write more tests for new features</li>
        
        </ul>
