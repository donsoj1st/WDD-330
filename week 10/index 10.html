		<H3 style="color: #250c06be;">Client-side form validation</H3>

		<ul>
			<li>Before submitting data to the server, it is important to ensure 
				all required form controls are filled out, in the correct format. 
				This is called client-side form validation, and helps ensure data 
				submitted matches the requirements setforth in the various form controls.
			</li>

			<li>Client-side validation is an initial check and an important feature of good user experience; by catching invalid data on
			the client-side, the user can fix it straight away. If it gets to the server and is then rejected, a noticeable delay is
			caused by a round trip to the server and then back to the client-side to tell the user to fix their data.</li>
		</ul>

		<H3 style="color: #250c06be;">why form validation </H3>
		<ul>
			<li>We want to get the right data, in the right format.</li>
			<li>We want to protect our users' data</li>
			<li>We want prevent the ptrogram from crashing</li>
		</ul>
		<H3 style="color: #250c06be;">Types of Form Validation</H3>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Built-in form validation</strong> Uses HTML5 form validation features. Built-in form validation has better performance than JavaScript,
				 but it is not as customizable as JavaScript validation.
		 	</li>
			<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>
			validation is coded using JavaScript. This validation is completely customizable, but you need to create it all (or use
			a library).<br>
			You must use JavaScript if you want to take control over the look and feel of native error messages or to deal with
				legacy browsers that do not support HTML's built-in form validation
			
			</li>
		<li>
			<strong>Constraint validation API</strong>
			You may want to impose more complex constraints, or to provide clearer reporting of validation failures than the
				defaults. This can be done using the Constraint Validation API.<br>
			Client-side form validation sometimes requires JavaScript if you want to customize styling and error messages, but
			 it always requires you to think carefully about the user. Always remember to help your users correct the data they
				provide.
		</li>
		
		</ul>
		<H3 style="color: #250c06be;">using fetch</H3>
		<ul>
			<li>
				<strong>Processing a text file line by line</strong>
				The data that are read from a response are not broken neatly at line boundaries and are Uint8Arrays, not strings. 
				If you want to fetch a text file and process it line by line, it is up to you to handle these complications.
			</li>
			<li><strong>Supplying your own request object</strong>
				Instead of passing a path to the resource you want to request into the fetch() call, 
				you can create a request object using the Request() constructor, and pass that in as a fetch() method argumen</li>
